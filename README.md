# Univelcity-project
Data science two-part project. 
First part of the project involves using 3 different classification algorithms to testltrain data and determine the best algorithm from their accuracy score.
The second part of the project involves comparing two datasets on a common column and extracting the missing values from the other dataset.

I have uploaded the second part of the project:
I was given a messy document and so I split the original into two documents, the second called an untitled document.
I cleaned the data from both seperately and then merged the results to give the final result.
